# Computer Science study notes

This is my personal note/reference database. It's not meant to be very didactic, especially since I learn by association and I often make connections to things I already know that were not mentioned in the notes, or leave some things out entirely when I'm already familiar with them.
Despite that, you're free to use it however you please!
