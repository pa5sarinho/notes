# BASH SCRIPTING

I am following Wikiversity's [Bash programming](https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Bash_programming) course in combination with the book "", as well as Learn Linux TV's "Bash Scripting on Linux" playlist on Youtube.
I'm using the Kate text editor for both the markdown files and the actual scripting. It's really good. Thanks KDE.

## Introduction

### Shebang

Shebang means this `#!`. Bash scripts have to start with `#!/bin/bash`.

> When a text file with a shebang is used as if it is an executable in a Unix-like operating system, the program loader
> mechanism parses the rest of the file's initial line as an interpreter directive.

Basically it specifies that it has to be executed using the bash shell.
